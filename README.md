# SteamGamePicker
A simple program using the Steam Web API to choose an unplayed game from your Steam library.

### Why?
I wanted to try something with the Steam Web API and I was just bored :P

## Usage
1. Download the latest release.
2. Unzip the file and run the .exe file.
3. Fill in your API key and SteamID64.
4. Click `Let's Go`, then optionally choose a playtime filter.
5. Click `Get Games` to fetch the list.
6. Click `Choose!` to choose a random game.
