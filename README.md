# SteamGamePicker
A simple program using the Steam Web API to choose an unplayed game from your Steam library.

### Why?
I wanted to try something with the Steam Web API and I was just bored :P

## Usage
1. Clone this repo, open it in Visual Studio.
2. In SteamGamePicker.cs change the `SteamWebAPIKey` variable to your [Steam Web API Key](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey).
3. Run/Build
4. Enter your SteamID in the corresponding textbox, choose your playtime filter.
5. Click `Get Games` to fetch the list.
6. Click `Choose!` to choose a random game.
